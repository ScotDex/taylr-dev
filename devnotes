Notes by Dex

File contained in the following location sudo nano /etc/supervisor/conf.d/myauth.conf - acts as a restraint configuration file
for celery, which is a python based worker function which was configured to run on a server that has around 8gig of ram - reduced these worke>

Subsequently I strongly recommend we work towards a modernization of enviroment, dockerize and offload functions to free services.

Cloud Flare for Reverse Proxy functions (offload SSL responsiblity as it would appear cert bot is on here)

Add static files to edge nodes for instant responses

SEAT perhaps?

Dev tools deployed for performance monitoring (dont know a great deal about AWS to conclude as of yet)

Modernization of database? (Himo a better choice in that case)

# Alliance Auth Documentation

By Will Francis


## Introduction

Implemenation of the Alliance Auth toolkit for Eve Online.  This is meant as a means to track information for players.

## Setup

This is meant to set up and establish a Docker version of the application.  It allows for more isloation.

### Information about OLD Install

The old install is using a baremetal desing which has most of things dispersed around the system.  We will want to make sure nginx is off, as well as other tooling is disabled
It is scattered around things from /var/www/auth to /opt/ and /home/ etc.  So, we need to clean up the System and make sure that the database is properly migrated over.

[TODO] list more information
